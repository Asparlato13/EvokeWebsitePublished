            “Your playing small does not serve the world. 
            There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. 
            We are all meant to shine, as children do. 
            It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone, and as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same.” <br>

<h3 id="what"> What is a mindset?</h3>
<p> 
    
  A mindset is a set of attitudes or beliefs that you hold to understand the world and yourself.
   Your frame of mind affects every aspect of your life from how you feel, think, and behave in any given situation. 
   According to Carol Dweck, Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, there are two kinds of mindsets: fixed and growth. 
   Opposed to someone with a growth mindset who believes <i>“…their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work”</i>, someone with a fixed mindset believes his/her abilities cannot be changed. (Dweck, 2006) 
   You can have both types of mindsets, a growth mindset in some situations (for instance, towards math) and a fixed mindset in others (for instance, towards sports).
   
   <br>
   <br>
  Understand: One of the many beauties of the brain is its malleability. You can rewire your brain to work for you, not against you. The cliché saying: change your attitude, change your life is a cliché for a reason. It works. For anybody. 
  
</p>

<h3 id="why"> Why is it important?</h3>
<p>
  It impacts your <b>success or failure</b>. Your frame of mind shapes how you cope with life's challenges. Unconsciously, it can limit the opportunities within your life and contribute to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. 


</p>



<h3 id="assessment">What is my mindset?</h3>

<p> 

  Where is your head at today? To find out, read the following statements to see which ones you agree with most. Observe without judgement.

    <th>Agree</th>
    <th>Disagree</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You can learn new things and improve your intelligence.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I	often	get	angry	when	I	get	feedback	about	my	
      performance.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The	harder	you	work	at	something,	the	better	you	will	
      be.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>People either have particular talents, or they don't. You can't just acquire talent for things like music, writing, art, or athletics.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Studying, working hard, and practicing new skills are all ways to develop new talents and abilities.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I like work that I'll learn from even if I make a lot of mistakes.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Truly	smart	people	do	not	need	to	try	hard.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>

</table>
</center>
<br>

<p>

  If you mostly agree with statements 1, 3, 5, and 6 then you probably have more of a growth mindset. However, if you mostly agree with statements 2, 4, and 7 then you probably tend to have a fixed mindset.
