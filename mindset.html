            “Your playing small does not serve the world. 
            There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. 
            We are all meant to shine, as children do. 
            It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone, and as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same.” <br>

<h3 id="what"> What is a mindset?</h3>
<p class="mindsetP"> 
   
A mindset refers to your set of attitudes or beliefs that shape your understanding of the world and yourself. 
It influences how you feel, think, and behave in various situations. Carol Dweck, a psychology professor at Stanford University, categorizes mindsets into two types: fixed and growth. 
While individuals with a growth mindset believe that their fundamental abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work, those with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities are unchangeable (Dweck, 2006). 
It is possible to have both mindsets, with a growth mindset in certain areas and a fixed mindset in others.
   
  

  
</p>

<h3 id="why"> Why is it important?</h3>
<p>
  Your mindset plays a crucial role in determining your success or failure. 
  It greatly influences how you handle life's challenges. Often without realizing it, your mindset can restrict the opportunities available to you and even contribute to mental health problems like depression and anxiety. 
  However, one remarkable aspect of the brain is its ability to adapt and change. 
  You have the power to rewire your brain, transforming it into a supportive and positive force in your life.
</p>



<h3 id="assessment">What is my mindset?</h3>

  Where is your head at today? To find out, read the following statements to see which ones you agree with most.

    <td>People either have particular talents, or they don't. You can't just acquire talent for things like music, writing, art, or athletics.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>

    <td>Studying, working hard, and practicing new skills are all ways to develop new talents and abilities.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>

    <td>I like work that I'll learn from even if I make a lot of mistakes.</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>

    <td>yes</td>

  </tr>

<p>

  If you mostly agree with statements 1, 3, 5, and 6 then you probably have more of a growth mindset. However, if you mostly agree with statements 2, 4, and 7 then you probably tend to have a fixed mindset.
